Folders: 
data_original: 
- Codebook.html
- Raw data is called exam_data.txt, and we have a joint file called exam_data_join.txt

data-processed
- datamerged_csv, is the merged file. 

Questions:
- exam_desrciption

Scripts: 
LoadData, contain the script for cleaning the data, and also different analysis merged by group members.


Complications: The first repository made for this group did not work. Made a new repository called RMED901_GROUP2_project. Did not have a good flow with committing, pushing and pulling initially.  

Experience learned: Everyone should create own scripts using their name and date and to the analysis there, and then add the analysis in the the main script (Load.Data). This will make the merging of different tasks much easier.
