Folders:

data_original: 
- Raw data: 
	- exam_data.txt (main raw file from Licorice study, pre and post-operational data). NB: This file was changed by Türküler Özgümüs due to wrong file structure.
	- exam_data_join.txt (additional data from the study, data from the surgical ward, identical patient IDs)

data-processed
- datamerged_csv, is a merged file of the two raw files. 

questions: Assignments from the RMED901 course
- exam_description

related_documents:
- Codebook.html, provided by supervisors. 

scripts: 
- LoadData.R, contain the script for cleaning the data, and also different analysis merged by group members.
- statistical_tests.R contains short scripts for performing statistical test.
- Ingvildscript.R, DAY7_vizualization_Ingvild and Melissa day6 are all scripts where we have tried things out.

NB: The first repository in GitHub made for this group did not work. Made a new repository called RMED901_GROUP2_project, use this.   

NB2: We have experienced that our initial work flow was inefficient, and would have worked differently to make the merging of different tasks much easier.
