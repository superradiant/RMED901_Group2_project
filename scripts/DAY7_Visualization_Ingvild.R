###4. Day 7: Create plots that would help answer these questions:

- Are there any correlated measurements?
#  - Does the age distribution depend on `treat`?
#  - Does the age distribution of the patients depend on their sex (`gender`)?
#  - Does the preoperative pain change with age of the patients?
#  - Do BMI and age have a linear relationship?
  
  
  #Does the age distribution depend on `treat`? the treat is bmi
  
  
# age and amount of smoking
  #Making a binary variable whether the patient smokes or not. HOWEVER, all patients are smokers
